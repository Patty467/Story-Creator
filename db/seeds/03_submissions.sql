-- for harmonic dust
  VALUES (1, 'His horse, a spectral echo of its former fire, plodded on, each hoofbeat a drumbeat against the silence, while the rider,
    nameless and adrift, faced the encroaching dusk, a whisper escaping his lips, "Hope''s on the horizon, if I can just outrun the dust."', 12, TRUE, FALSE, 1, 1),
(2, 'Sunset bled canyons crimson, coyote''s laugh mocked her lonely boots on unforgiving sand. She chased ghosts, not the sun.', 2, TRUE, FALSE, 2, 1),
(3, 'Sunset painted the prairie like a rogue artist using ketchup and mustard, and a dusty tumbleweed chased after a startled jackrabbit,
    mistaking its fluffy tail for a runaway carrot. Our heroine, Calamity Cupcake, rode a horse named Clementine
    (mostly because it wouldn''t answer to anything else), wearing a hat so wide it could double as a satellite dish.
    She hummed a tuneless song about lost socks and rogue pickles, her eyes scanning the horizon for adventure,
    preferably the kind involving pie and a nap. She wasn''t chasing ghosts or redemption,
    just a decent cup of sarsaparilla and maybe a squirrel with a monocle (she had a thing for dapper rodents).
    So yeah, desert sunset? More like dessert dreams and silly critter shenanigans. Now, where''d that tumbleweed get to?
    Clementine seemed awfully interested...', 6, TRUE, FALSE, 3, 1),
(4, 'Suddenly, a tumbleweed the size of a prize pumpkin rolled past, sporting a jaunty cowboy hat and whistling "Dixie" off-key.
    The rider blinked, squinting harder through the grit at the dust bunny''s jaunty sashay. Was he hallucinating from thirst,
    or had the desert truly gone loco? With a sigh that stirred the dust devils, he spurred his pinto onward, muttering,
    "Just another Tuesday in the Badlands, I reckon."', 2, TRUE, FALSE, 4, 1),
(5, 'Buttercup nuzzled the latch on her stall door, its rusty tongue surrendering with a groan, and with a heart pounding like a hummingbird''s wings,
    she stepped out into the dew-kissed dawn, ready to trade the familiar scent of straw for the sweet, watery perfume of freedom.', 6, TRUE, FALSE, 2, 3),
(6, 'A glint of mischief twinkled in Buttercup''s eyes as she swiped a fallen feather from the windowsill,
    tucking it behind her ear with a flick of her nose. With a playful snort, she trotted towards the pond,
    the feather a silent banner declaring her intent. The ducks, their initial alarm forgotten, watched in a feathered flurry as Buttercup neared,
    a grin plastered across her chestnut face. "Prepare yourselves, my feathery friends," she whinnied, her voice bubbling with glee,
    "for today, a mare shall take flight!"', 8, TRUE, FALSE, 3, 3),
(7, 'The sun-dappled water shimmered, a runway of liquid sky just begging for a four-legged cannonball.', 2, TRUE, FALSE, 4, 3),
(8, 'With a grin wider than the Cheshire Cat'';s, she scooped a spoonful of soup, the broth''s swirling alphabet swirling into a liquid map,
    vowels charting constellations and consonants carving paths through dreams. This wasn''t just a meal; it was a passport to a thousand untold stories,
    and Alice, spoon poised, was ready to devour them all.', 10, FALSE, TRUE, 1, 4),
(9, 'The first letter dissolved on her tongue, a tangy S whispering secrets of starfaring pirates, and reality blurred around her.
    As the last consonant slipped past her lips, the apartment vanished, replaced by an inky ocean dotted with constellation-islands,
    Alice, with a giggle that echoed across the waves, ready to chart her own whimsical course.', 10, FALSE, TRUE, 1, 4),
(10, 'With a slurp, she swallowed the final letter, a mischievous W winkling on its way down. Before the spoon clattered in the bowl,
    the room around her warped, walls rippling like mirages under a desert sun. Gone was the hum of the city,
    replaced by the rustle of wind through endless plains of alphabet flowers, each petal blooming with secrets,
    waiting to be plucked and woven into new worlds. Alice, a grin etched like sunshine on her face, reached for the first,
    ready to paint her own reality, petal by vibrant petal', 10, FALSE, TRUE, 1, 4);
